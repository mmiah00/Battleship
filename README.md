## Description
This project is a terminal-based version of Battleship the board game. Battleship is a 2 player turn based game with networking serving as the connection. To start, each player place down 5 ships of sizes 2, 3, 3, 4, and 5 on a 8x8 board. After both players placed their ships, they take turns guessing and attacking coordinates where they think an enemy ship is located. Once the other player's fleet has entirely been eliminated, you win. In our project, we used a struct and 2d array to manage the board and ships. ~ represents water, H represents a ship, O represents a successful hit, and X represents a failed hit. When attacking, details will be recorded by writing to the history.txt file. When prompted to display history, the history.txt file will be catted. When the victory conditions are fufilled, players will be prompted to decide where to export their history file to keep as bragging rights.
